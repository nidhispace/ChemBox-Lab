# Atmospheric Chemistry Box Modeling with KPP + BOXMOX

A practical, hands-on guide to building and running atmospheric chemistry **box models** using **KPP** (Kinetic PreProcessor) and **BOXMOX**.
This repository is designed to take you from zero to fully working simulations, with clear examples and organized chapters.

---

## 📌 What’s Inside

✅ Introduction to box models

✅ How KPP generates chemistry solvers

✅ How BOXMOX uses those solvers in simulations

✅ Step-by-step tutorials with increasing complexity

✅ Realistic chemical schemes and multi-scenario examples

You’ll find:

* **Basic KPP mechanism setup**
* Writing `.eqn` files from scratch
* KPP compilation and solver generation
* Linking KPP outputs with BOXMOX
* Running simulations with different reaction schemes
* Visualizing and analyzing results

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python 3.x (for plotting/processing)
* BoxModel (BOXMOX)
* KPP installed and working on your machine
* Standard build tools: `gcc`, `make`, etc.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nidhispace/KPP-BOXMOX_box_model.git
cd KPP-BOXMOX_box_model

# Example: Compile a simple mechanism
cd examples/simple_NOx_example
make
./boxmodel
```

Then open the output results in your plotting tool of choice (example Python script included).

## 🧪 Example Applications

* NOx chemistry under sunlight
* Isoprene oxidation scheme
* VOC + NOₓ pollution scenario
* Sensitivity analysis and emission perturbations

More examples will be added over time.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Project

To create a **clear, accessible** learning resource for:

* Students starting with atmospheric chemistry modeling
* Researchers needing quick reference setups
* Anyone wanting to test chemistry schemes without full 3-D models
